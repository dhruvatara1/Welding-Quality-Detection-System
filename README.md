# Welding-Quality-Detection-System
This project simulates an Intelligent Welding Quality Assurance System. In real-world manufacturing, welding defects like Burn Through, Incomplete Fusion, and Porosity can compromise structural integrity. This system uses Machine Learning to:  Predict Weld Strength: Estimate tensile strength based on process parameters
